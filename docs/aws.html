    <p>For production, Boxfuse can run your Apps on <strong>AWS</strong> using your AWS account.</p>

    <h2>Environments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>test</li>
        <li>prod</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As well as any <a href="/docs/environments.html#custom">additional custom environments</a> you have created.</p>

    <h2>Regions</h2>

    <p>Boxfuse fully supports the ap-northeast-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-southeast-2, eu-central-1, eu-west-1, sa-east-1,
        us-east-1, us-west-1 &amp; us-west-2 regions.</p>

    <p>We recommend the <strong>eu-central-1</strong>, <strong>eu-west-1</strong> and <strong>us-east-1</strong> regions
        as they are <strong>optimized for deployment speed</strong> with new AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) created in under 60 seconds.
        <strong>This is 5x to 10x faster than any other tool in the industry!</strong></p>

    <p>As Boxfuse expands its footprint, further regions will be optimized for fast deployment. The order will be based on based on customer usage and demand.
        This does not affect the runtime speed of your instance, which is determined by the instance type you selected.</p>

    <h2>Instance Types</h2>

    <p>Boxfuse supports all t2, m3, m4, c3, c4 and r3 instance types in all available regions.</p>

    <h2>App Types</h2>

    <p>Both <strong>Elastic IP</strong> (single Instance) and <strong>ELB</strong> (multiple instances in multiple availability zones) apps are supported.
        Boxfuse always performs <strong>Zero Downtime upgrades</strong> of your apps when you redeploy them.</p>

    <p>For production, Boxfuse can run your Apps on <strong>AWS</strong> using your AWS account.</p>

    <h2>Environments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>test</li>
        <li>prod</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As well as any <a href="/docs/environments#custom">additional custom environments</a> you have created.</p>

    <h2 id="regions">Regions</h2>

    <p>Boxfuse fully supports the ap-northeast-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-southeast-2, eu-central-1, eu-west-1, sa-east-1,
        us-east-1, us-west-1 &amp; us-west-2 regions.</p>

    <p>We recommend <strong>the regions in Australia, the EU and the US</strong> (ap-southeast-2, eu-central-1, eu-west-1, us-east-1,
        us-west-1 and us-west-2)
        as we have <strong>optimized them for AMI creation speed</strong> with new Amazon Machine Images created in under 60 seconds.
        This is 5x to 10x faster than any other tool in the industry.</p>

    <p>As Boxfuse expands its footprint, further regions will be optimized for fast deployment. The order will be based on based on customer usage and demand.
        This does not affect the runtime speed of your instance, which is determined by the instance type you selected.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> It is currently not possible to select an AWS region that does not have a default VPC. If your AWS account is missing a default VPC, you can ask AWS support to (re-)create it. Requests are usually fulfilled within a few hours.</p>

    <h2 id="vpcs">VPCs</h2>

    <p>Both the <code>test</code> and the <code>prod</code> <a href="/docs/environments">environment</a> are created within the default VPC of the AWS region you selected for your Boxfuse account.</p>

    <p>You can use non-default VPCs as well as alternate regions in any <a href="/docs/environments#custom">custom environments</a> you create.</p>

    <h2>Instance Types</h2>

    <p>Boxfuse supports all t2, m3, m4, c3, c4 and r3 instance types in all available regions.</p>

    <h2>App Types</h2>

    <p>Both <strong>Elastic IP</strong> (single Instance) and <strong>ELB</strong> (multiple instances in multiple availability zones) apps are supported.
        Boxfuse always performs <strong>Zero Downtime upgrades</strong> of your apps when you redeploy them.</p>

    <h2 id="tagging">Tagging</h2>

    <p>Wherever supported by AWS and applicable all AWS resources created by Boxfuse are consistently tagged with one or more of the following tags:</p>

    <table class="table table-striped">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>AWS Tag Name</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>boxfuse:env</code></td>

        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>(For EC2 instances only) The Boxfuse image and environment</td>

    <p>For production, Boxfuse can run your Apps on <strong>AWS</strong> using your AWS account.</p>

    <h2>Environments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>test</li>
        <li>prod</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As well as any <a href="/docs/environments#custom">additional custom environments</a> you have created.</p>

    <h2 id="regions">Regions</h2>

    <p>Boxfuse fully supports the ap-northeast-1, ap-south-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-southeast-2, ca-central-1, eu-central-1,
        eu-west-1, eu-west-2, sa-east-1, us-east-1, us-east-2, us-west-1 &amp; us-west-2 regions.</p>

    <p>We recommend <strong>the regions in Australia, the EU and the US</strong> (ap-southeast-2, eu-central-1, eu-west-1, us-east-1,
        us-west-1 and us-west-2)
        as we have <strong>optimized them for AMI creation speed</strong> with new Amazon Machine Images created in under 60 seconds.
        This is 5x to 10x faster than any other tool in the industry.</p>

    <p>As Boxfuse expands its footprint, further regions will be optimized for fast deployment. The order will be based on based on customer usage and demand.
        This does not affect the runtime speed of your instance, which is determined by the instance type you selected.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> It is currently not possible to select an AWS region that does not have a default VPC. If your AWS account is missing a default VPC, you can ask AWS support to (re-)create it. Requests are usually fulfilled within a few hours.</p>

    <h2 id="vpcs">VPCs</h2>

    <p>Both the <code>test</code> and the <code>prod</code> <a href="/docs/environments">environment</a> are created within the default VPC of the AWS region you selected for your Boxfuse account.</p>

    <p>You can use non-default VPCs as well as alternate regions in any <a href="/docs/environments#custom">custom environments</a> you create.</p>

    <h2 id="instance-types">Instance Types</h2>

    <p>Boxfuse supports all t2, m3, m4, c3, c4, r3 and r4 instance types in all available regions.</p>

    <h2>App Types</h2>

    <p>All <a href="/docs/apptypes">app types</a> are supported.
        Boxfuse always performs <strong>Zero Downtime upgrades</strong> of your apps when you redeploy them.</p>

    <h2 id="security-groups">Security Groups</h2>

    <p>By default Boxfuse will create a security group for each deployment. This security group will be tagged with the
        app, the version and the environment. It will
    automatically have the correct ports for your image open with the appropriate
        <a href="/blog/restricted-ports">restrictions</a> if any were defined.</p>

    <p>Additionally every instance of an app also receives a marker security group tagged with the app and environment names.
    This makes it easy to refer to all instances of an app from other security groups, regardless of the version.</p>

    <p>Alternatively you can also explicitly configure a custom security group for every app in each <a href="/docs/environments">environment</a>.</p>

    <p>All security groups that have been created by Boxfuse are automatically removed when they are no longer in use.</p>

    <h2 id="tagging">Tagging</h2>

    <p>Wherever supported by AWS and applicable all AWS resources created by Boxfuse are consistently tagged with one or more of the following tags:</p>

    <table class="table table-striped">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>AWS Tag Name</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>boxfuse:env</code></td>
            <td>The Boxfuse <a href="/docs/environments">environment</a></td>
            <td>prod</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>boxfuse:app</code></td>
            <td>The Boxfuse application</td>
            <td>myuser/myapp</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>boxfuse:image</code></td>
            <td>The Boxfuse image</td>
            <td>myuser/myapp:1.2.3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>Name</code></td>
            <td>(For EC2 instances only) The Boxfuse image and environment</td>
            <td>boxfuse myuser/myapp:1.2.3@prod</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2 id="instance-profiles">Instance Profiles</h2>

    <p>To make it easy to access other AWS services, Boxfuse let's you configure IAM Instance Profiles to pass temporary
        AWS credentials to EC2 instances without needing to bake them into your image.</p>

    <p>Note that by default for apps using CloudWatch Logs, Boxfuse will configure your instances to use an IAM Instance Profile
        that allows your application to invoke <code>logs:PutLogEvents</code>. This is required in order to be able to send log events to CloudWatch Logs.</p>

    <p>If you configure your app to use a custom Instance Profile instead and it needs to send logs to CloudWatch Logs,
        you have to ensure that the IAM policy attached to your instance profile does include the following statement:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">"Statement": [
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "logs:PutLogEvents"
    ],
    "Resource": [
      "arn:aws:logs:*:*:*"
    ]
  }
]</pre>

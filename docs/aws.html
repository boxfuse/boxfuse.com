    <p>For production, Boxfuse can run your Apps on <strong>AWS</strong> using your AWS account.</p>

    <h2>Environments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>test</li>
        <li>prod</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As well as any <a href="/docs/environments.html#custom">additional environments</a> you have created.</p>

    <h2>Regions</h2>

    <p>Boxfuse supports the ap-northeast-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-southeast-2, eu-central-1, eu-west-1, sa-east-1,
        us-east-1, us-west-1 &amp; us-west-2 regions.</p>
    <p>We recommend the <strong>eu-central-1</strong> region,
        as it is currently the only one optimized for deployment speed with new Images <strong>deployed in under 60 seconds</strong>.
        As Boxfuse expands its footprint, more regions will be optimized for fast deployment. The order will be based on based on customer usage and demand.
        This does not affect the runtime speed of your instance, which is determined by the instance type you selected.</p>

    <h2>Instance Types</h2>

    <p>Boxfuse supports all t2, m3, m4, c3, c4 and r3 instance types in all available regions.</p>

    <h2>App Types</h2>

    <p>Both <strong>Elastic IP</strong> (single Instance) and <strong>ELB</strong> (multiple instances in multiple availability zones) apps are supported.
        Boxfuse always performs <strong>Zero Downtime upgrades</strong> of your apps when you redeploy them.</p>

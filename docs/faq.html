    <h2>Where can I ask a question?</h2>

    <p>We are actively monitoring the <a class="stackoverflow-tag" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/boxfuse">boxfuse</a> tag
        on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/boxfuse"><strong>StackOverflow</strong></a>. Ask
    your question there and either we or someone from the community will answer it.</p>

    <h2>Where can I report an issue?</h2>

    <p>We have a <a href="https://github.com/boxfuse/boxfuse-issues/issues"><strong>public issue tracker</strong></a> on GitHub, where you can easily report any issues you may find.</p>

    <h2>How can I use a database?</h2>

    <p>You can use any external database. For optimal integration, we recommend using our automatically provisioned
        <a href="/docs/databases">Amazon RDS PostgreSQL</a> instances for your relational database needs.</p>

    <h2>How can I use access my logs?</h2>

    <p>You can access instance boot logs using the <a href="/docs/commands/logs">boxfuse logs command</a>. For your
        application logs you should use a central log server. Great hosted solutions include <a href="https://www.loggly.com/">Loggly</a>,
        <a href="https://logentries.com/">Logentries</a> and <a href="https://papertrailapp.com/">Papertrail</a>. You can read more about this in our <a href="/blog/logging-cloudnative">blog post</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="tmp">Can I store temporary files on the filesystem of an instance?</h2>

    <p>Filesystems on Boxfuse images are strictly ephemeral and all changes are lost upon reboot. To store data permanently we highly
    recommend using a service like S3 or RDS. Some application however do require local storage of temporary data. By default
    Boxfuse provisions 1 GB (configurable up to 16 TB) of space under <code>/tmp</code> for this. <strong>All writes should happen
    to <code>/tmp</code></strong> as anywhere else will cause the system to use up more RAM.</p>

    <h2>Where can I ask a question?</h2>

    <p>We are actively monitoring the <a class="stackoverflow-tag" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/boxfuse">boxfuse</a> tag
        on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/boxfuse"><strong>StackOverflow</strong></a>. Ask
    your question there and either we or someone from the community will answer it.</p>

    <h2>Where can I report an issue?</h2>

    <p>We have set up a <a href="https://github.com/boxfuse/boxfuse-issues/issues"><strong>public issue tracker</strong></a> on GitHub, so you can easily report any issues you may find.</p>

    <h2>How can I use a database?</h2>

    <p>You can use any external database. For optimal integration, we recommend using
        <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon RDS</a> for your relational database needs.
        It is very reliable and easy to get started with.</p>

    <h2>How can I use access my logs?</h2>

    <p>You can access instance boot logs using the <a href="/docs/commands/logs.html">boxfuse logs command</a>. For your
        application logs you should use a central log server. Great hosted solutions include <a href="https://www.loggly.com/">Loggly</a>,
        <a href="https://logentries.com/">Logentries</a> and <a href="https://papertrailapp.com/">Papertrail</a>. You can read more about this in our <a href="/blog/logging-cloudnative.html">blog post</a>.</p>

    <h2>Where can I ask a question?</h2>

    <p>We are actively monitoring the <a class="stackoverflow-tag" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/boxfuse">boxfuse</a> tag
        on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/boxfuse"><strong>StackOverflow</strong></a>. Ask
    your question there and either we or someone from the community will answer it.</p>

    <h2>Where can I report an issue?</h2>

    <p>We have a <a href="https://github.com/boxfuse/boxfuse-issues/issues"><strong>public issue tracker</strong></a> on GitHub, where you can easily report any issues you may find.</p>

    <h2>How can I use a database?</h2>

    <p>You can use any external database. For optimal integration, we recommend using our automatically provisioned
        <a href="/docs/databases">Amazon RDS PostgreSQL</a> instances for your relational database needs.</p>

    <h2>How can I use access my logs?</h2>

    <p>You can access instance boot logs using the <a href="/docs/commands/logs">boxfuse logs command</a>. For your
        application logs you should use a central log server. Great hosted solutions include <a href="https://www.loggly.com/">Loggly</a>,
        <a href="https://logentries.com/">Logentries</a> and <a href="https://papertrailapp.com/">Papertrail</a>. You can read more about this in our <a href="/blog/logging-cloudnative">blog post</a>.</p>

    <h2>My instance runs into a health check timeout. What could be the issue?</h2>

    <p>A health check timeout typically occurs for one of two reasons:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Your application startup is effectively slower as the health check timeout</li>
        <li>The health check and the application configuration don't match</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The first problem can be solved by either moving to a larger and faster instance, increasing
        <code>healthcheck.timeout</code> or optimizing the application startup.</p>

    <p>The second problem can be due to either the <code>healthcheck.path</code> being incorrect,
        <code>healthcheck.port</code> being incorrect or the ports configuration simply not matching the ports
        opened up by the application. Example: the http port is configured to be 80, yet the application listens on 8080.
        The solution for all of these is the same, carefully review your configuration and check the <a href="/docs/commands#logs">logs</a>
        to make sure everything matches.

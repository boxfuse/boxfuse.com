    <p>Boxfuse supports Apps written in Java or any other language and packaged as a <strong>War file</strong> running on either <strong>Tomcat 7.x or 8.x</strong> using either <strong>OpenJDK 7.x or 8.x</strong>.</p>

    <p class="doc-section">HTTP</p>

    <p>By default, Boxfuse will automatically configure Tomcat to listen to HTTP traffic on port 80.</p>

    <p class="doc-section">SSL (TLS) / HTTPS</p>

    <p>To use <strong>HTTPS</strong> simply add the KeyStore containing your SSL certificate inside the .war file as
        <code>/WEB-INF/keystore.jks</code>. It must be secured with the standard password <em>changeit</em>.
        Boxfuse will then automatically configure Tomcat to start serving traffic via HTTPS on port 443, as well as
        <strong>automatically redirect any insecure HTTP traffic to a secure HTTPS connection</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="doc-section">Root Certificates</p>

    <p>By default, Boxfuse uses the <strong>same root certificate bundle as the latest version of Firefox</strong>.
        You can, however, ship your own set of root certificates, by placing them in a KeyStore at <code>/WEB-INF/cacerts</code>.
        Boxfuse will then automatically configure both the JRE and Tomcat to use these instead.
    </p>

    <p class="doc-section">Java Agents</p>

    <p>If you wish to launch the JRE with one or more Java Agents, simply place the Java Agent Jar files under
        <code>/WEB-INF/javaagents/</code>.
        Boxfuse will then <strong>automatically configure the JRE to use these Java Agents</strong>.

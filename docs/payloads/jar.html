    <p>Boxfuse supports Apps written in Java or any other language and packaged as an <strong>Executable Jar file</strong> running on either <strong>OpenJDK 7.x or 8.x</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Root Certificates</h2>

    <p>By default, Boxfuse uses the <strong>same root certificate bundle as the latest version of Firefox</strong>.
        Additionally Boxfuse also includes the <strong>root certificates for Amazon RDS</strong>, so you can connect securely to RDS databases out of the box.</p>
    <p>You can, however, ship your own set of root certificates, by placing them in a KeyStore inside the Jar file as <code>/cacerts</code>.
        Boxfuse will then automatically configure the JRE to use these instead.
    </p>

    <h2>Java Agents</h2>

    <p>If you wish to launch the JRE with one or more Java Agents, simply place the Java Agent Jar files inside the Jar file under
        <code>/javaagents/</code>. Boxfuse will then <strong>automatically configure the JRE to use these Java Agents</strong>.

    <h2>My instance runs into a health check timeout. What could be the issue?</h2>

    <p>A health check timeout typically occurs for one of two reasons:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Your application startup is effectively slower as the health check timeout</li>
        <li>The health check and the application configuration don't match</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The first problem can be solved by either moving to a larger and faster instance, increasing
        <code>healthcheck.timeout</code> or optimizing the application startup.</p>

    <p>The second problem can be due to either the <code>healthcheck.path</code> being incorrect,
        <code>healthcheck.port</code> being incorrect or the ports configuration simply not matching the ports
        opened up by the application. Example: the http port is configured to be 80, yet the application listens on 8080.
        The solution for all of these is the same, carefully review your configuration and check the <a href="/docs/commands#logs">logs</a>
        to make sure everything matches.

            <p><strong>10th September 2015</strong> in <strong>Oslo, Norway</strong></p>
            <p>The case for running an own datacenter is vanishing rapidly. The cloud seduces with a low barrier of entry and full flexibility. Infrastructure can be spun up almost instantly in a fully automated way through an API. All this with no upfront costs and the ability to decommission it just as fast. But what does this mean for our applications and their architecture? Can we just lift and shift them to the cloud? Everything comes at a price. To be able to fully leverage the potential of the cloud, new challenges must be mastered: from data privacy and security to cost-based architectures, dynamic provisioning, service discovery and efficient deployment models. This talk provides architects and developers clear answers and battle-tested solutions for a successful journey to infrastructure heaven.</p>

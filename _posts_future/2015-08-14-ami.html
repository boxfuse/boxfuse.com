    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Try it now</h2>
    <p>Have fun! And if you haven't already,
        <a href="https://console.boxfuse.com"><strong>sign up for your
            Boxfuse account</strong></a> now. <a href="https://boxfuse.com"><strong>Boxfuse</strong></a> intelligently
        analyses your application and
        <strong>generates minimal images in seconds</strong>.
        There is no general purpose operating system and no tedious provisioning. Boxfuse images are lean, secure and
        efficient. You
        can run them on VirtualBox for development and deploy them unchanged and with <strong>zero downtime on
            AWS</strong> for test and
        production. All you need is a GitHub user
        and you'll be up and running in no time. The <a href="/pricing.html">Boxfuse free plan</a> aligns
        perfectly with the AWS free tier, so you can deploy your application to EC2 completely free.</p>

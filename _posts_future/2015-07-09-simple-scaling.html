    <p><strong>On the public cloud cost is an important driver for the way we architect our systems.</strong>
        In stark contrast to on premise setups where hardware is almost universally a sunk cost,
        public clouds like AWS offer utility-like pricing. You essentially pay for what use. And you optimize your budget
        by dynamically provisioning your infrastructure to optimally handle the current load on the system.
        Regardless of whether you need more or less capacity, you need to be able to scale both
        the size and the number of instances for any given service. Doing this quickly and reliably has not always been easy.
        In this post we'll at how <a href="/learn/why.html">immutable infrastructure</a> greatly simplifies all this.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling</h2>

    <p>When it comes to scaling, it really boils down to two options. You can <strong>scale horizontally</strong> by adding instances
        (<em>scaling out</em>) or removing instances (<em>scaling in</em>). Or you can go the other way change not the quantity, but the size
    of your instances. You can then <strong>scale vertically</strong> to bigger machines (<em>scaling up</em>)
        or smaller machines (<em>scaling down</em>).</p>

    <p><strong>While this sounds easy, its has traditionally come with a number of challenges</strong>, the most common ones being
        reliability, state, performance and service discovery. However as you'll see these aren't intrinsic problems to scaling.
    They come from the way we have traditionally provisioned machines, located services and dealt with state.</p>
